### Project Description
Space Booker is a web-based application that lets students and staff check and book college spaces like auditoriums, AV rooms, seminar halls, and labs. It shows real-time availability of resources like seating, fans, lights, AC, and computers. Admins manage bookings and update resources, while students can easily view and request venues. The system ensures efficient space usage, avoids conflicts, and simplifies event planning on campus.

### The Problem statement
SPACE BOOKER solves the problem of manual, confusing, and conflicting space bookings in a college or campus by providing a real-time online system where students can book halls or labs, admins can approve/reject requests, and all availability and issues are tracked efficiently.

### The Solution
SPACE BOOKER streamlines campus space bookings by allowing real-time student reservations, admin approvals, and automatic tracking of availability and issues.
